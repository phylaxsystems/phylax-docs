# Phylax Common

- forge: Code inside the `forge` module is largely taken from the `bin` [module](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/0232ee56a20324af443e69b0c42db7c0b12031d8/crates/forge/bin/cmd) of the `forge` crate, which is part of Foundry. The code is licensed under MIT and is re-used and re-licensed here in the `phylax-common` crate.
