## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you're running Linux or MacOS.
## Install

First we need to make sure rust is install on your system. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
```
Once this is done we need to clone the `phylax-monitor` git repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phylaxsystems/phylax-monitor.git
```
Then we need to navigate to the `phylax-monitor` directory:

```bash
cd phylax-monitor
```

Now we need to initialize the repository settings:

```bash
make init
```

Lastly we need to build the Phylax Monitor:
  
```bash
cargo build --release
```
This last step might take a bit of time, so go grab a drink and come back in a few minutes.
