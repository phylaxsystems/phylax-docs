## Getting Started

If you haven't installed Phylax yet, follow the [installation instructions](monitor/guides/monitor-how-to-install) before proceeding.

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run the Phylax Monitor for your project:

1. Create a new Phylax project:

   ```bash
   phylax init my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Configure your project:
   
   Open the `phylax.toml` file in your project directory and adjust the settings as needed. You can specify the blockchain network, contract addresses, and other monitoring parameters.
   For a complete list of options, see the [Configuration Reference](../../phylax-monitor/references/configuration).

3. Write your first alert:
   
   Let's create a simple alert contract that creates a chart that shows the amount of stETH currently restaked on Eigenlayer.
   Create a new file, for example `stethRestaked.a.sol`:

    ```solidity
        // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
        pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

        import "phylax-std/Alert.sol";
        import "phylax-std/Chart.sol";
        import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

        contract StethRestaked is Alert {
            IERC20 public rethToken;
            address public rethEigenPoolAddress;

            function setUp() public {
                rethEigenPoolAddress = 0x1BeE69b7dFFfA4E2d53C2a2Df135C388AD25dCD2;
                rethToken = IERC20(0xae78736Cd615f374D3085123A210448E74Fc6393); // rETH erc20 contract
            }
        
            function charts() public virtual override {
                createChart({
                    description: "Amount of rETH restaked on Eigenlayer",
                    xAxis: XAxis.BlockNumber,
                    yAxis: YAxis.Uint256,
                    yAxisName: "rETH restaked",
                    visualization: Visualization.Line
                });
            }

            function chart_example() public {
                writeToChart("rETH restaked", rethToken.balanceOf(rethEigenPoolAddress));
            }

            function alertPoolEmpty() public view returns (bool) {
                return rethToken.balanceOf(rethEigenPoolAddress) == 0;
            }
        }
   ```

4. Run the Phylax Monitor:

   ```bash
   phylax run
   ```

   This command will compile your contracts, start the monitoring server, and host the dashboard.

5. Access the dashboard:
   
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Phylax Syn dashboard.


You're now ready to start writing alerts and monitoring your smart contracts. A good place to start is the [How to Write Alerts](monitor/guides/monitor-how-to-alerts) guide.
