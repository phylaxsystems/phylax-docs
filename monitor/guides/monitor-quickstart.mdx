## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you're running Linux or MacOS and have the following installed on your system:

```text
- Rust / Cargo
- git
- npm
```

## Install

We've created a convenient installer for you called Phylum. It will install `phylax` on your system in a couple of minutes and then you're good to go.

To install run:

```bash
curl -L http://phylaxsystems.github.io/phylum/install | bash
```

This will take a couple of moments, so go grab a drink and come back in a few minutes.

You can verify that `phylax` is correctly installed by running:

```bash
phylax --version
```

This should give you a result containing `phylax Version`, `Commit SHA` and some other values.

## Run

You're now all set and ready to run the Phylax Monitor. To do this go to your Phylax project and run the following:

```bash
phylax run
```

This will compile your contracts, start the monitoring server and host the dashboard.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working Phylax Monitor install, we encourage you to explore the rest of the docs to get familiar with the power of the Phylax Monitor. 
A good place to start is the [How to Write Alerts](monitor/guides/monitor-how-to-alerts) guide.
