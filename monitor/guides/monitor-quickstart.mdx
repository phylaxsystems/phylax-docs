## Getting Started

If you haven't installed Phylax yet, follow the [installation instructions](monitor/guides/monitor-how-to-install) before proceeding.

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run the Phylax Monitor for your project:

1. Create a new Phylax project:

    ```bash
    phylax init my-project
    cd my-project
    ```

2. Configure your project:
   
    Open the `phylax.toml` file in your project directory and adjust the settings as needed. You can specify the blockchain network, contract addresses, and other monitoring parameters.
    For a complete list of options, see the [Configuration Reference](../../phylax-monitor/references/configuration).

    A bare minimum `phylax.toml` file for a project that monitors the rETH contract on Ethereum Mainnet is:

    ```toml
    [[watchers]]
    name = "ETH"
    chain = "mainnet"
    endpoint = "${YOUR_RPC_URL}"

    [[alerts]]
    name = "rethRestaked"
    alert_path = "RethRestaked.a.sol"
    on_watchers = ["ETH"]
    ```

    Above it enough to have a working configuration for your project. Here's a quick explanation of the above configuration:

    - `[[watchers]]`: Watchers represent a source of data, which may send data for downstream alerts or actions to process.
    - `name`: A unique name for the watcher.
    - `chain`: The chain to monitor.
    - `endpoint`: Your RPC URL for the blockchain.

    - `[[alerts]]`: An alert is the process that analyzes the data fetched by the watcher and triggers notifications if conditions are met.
    - `name`: A unique name for the alert.
    - `alert_path`: The path to the alert contract.
    - `on_watchers`: The unique names of the watcher that the alert should be run on.

3. Write your first alert:
   
   Let's create a simple alert contract that creates a chart that shows the amount of rETH currently restaked on Eigenlayer on Ethereum Mainnet.
   Create a new file, for example `rethRestaked.a.sol`:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    import "phylax-std/Alert.sol";
    import "phylax-std/Chart.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

    contract RethRestaked is Alert {
        IERC20 public rethToken;
        address public rethEigenPoolAddress;

        function setUp() public {
            rethEigenPoolAddress = 0x1BeE69b7dFFfA4E2d53C2a2Df135C388AD25dCD2;
            rethToken = IERC20(0xae78736Cd615f374D3085123A210448E74Fc6393); // rETH erc20 contract
        }
    
        function charts() public virtual override {
            createChart({
                description: "Amount of rETH restaked on Eigenlayer",
                xAxis: XAxis.BlockNumber,
                yAxis: YAxis.Uint256,
                yAxisName: "rETH restaked",
                visualization: Visualization.Line
            });
        }

        function chart_example() public {
            writeToChart("rETH restaked", rethToken.balanceOf(rethEigenPoolAddress));
        }

        function alertPoolEmpty() public view returns (bool) {
            return rethToken.balanceOf(rethEigenPoolAddress) == 0;
        }
    }
   ```

   The above contract creates a chart that shows the amount of rETH restaked on Eigenlayer and an alert that triggers if the amount of rETH restaked is 0.
   The `setUp` function will be run before each function is run. In this case it initializes the rETH contract and Eigenlayer rETH pool address.
   The `charts` function is used to declare the charts that will be displayed in the dashboard.
   The `chart_example` function is used to write data to the chart.
   The `alertPoolEmpty` function is used to trigger the alert.

4. Run Phylax Syn:

   ```bash
   phylax run
   ```

   This command will compile your contracts, start Phylax Syn, and host the dashboard.

5. Access the dashboard:
   
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Phylax Syn dashboard.


You're now ready to start writing alerts and monitoring your smart contracts. A good place to start is the [How to Write Alerts](monitor/guides/monitor-how-to-alerts) guide.
