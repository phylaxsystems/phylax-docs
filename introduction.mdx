## What is Phylax?

We want to solve security so that crypto can win.
We create intuitive, open-standard products rooted in first-principles thinking, making robust security accessible to all.
Weâ€™re not just protecting assets, we are enabling crypto to regain its credibility. 

## Phylax Monitor

The Monitor empowers dApp developers with Solidity-based alerts and visualizations.
Transforming complex blockchain monitoring into an intuitive process that accelerates development of secure, reliable DeFi protocols.
Learn more about the Monitor in the [Monitor Quickstart](quickstart).

## Phylax Credible Layer

The Credible Security layer enables dapps to embed and verifiably enforce your rules in the base layer, enabling the world to deploy capital confidently.
This product is still in the early stages of development, so there is no documentation available yet.

## Community
Although our products are in development we invite you to join our community where we will share all the latest updates and announce products launches. 
We look forward to seeing you there and discussing how credible security could help your DApp.
