## What is Phylax?

We want to solve security so that crypto can win.
We create intuitive, open-standard products rooted in first-principles thinking, making robust security accessible to all.
Weâ€™re not just protecting assets, we are enabling crypto to regain its credibility. 

## Community
Although our products are in development we invite you to join our community where we will share all the latest updates and announce products launches. 
We look forward to seeing you there and discussing how credible security could help your DApp.
