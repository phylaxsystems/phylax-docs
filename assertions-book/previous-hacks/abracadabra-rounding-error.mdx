title: Abracadabra Rounding Error Attack
description: Rounding error in Abracadabra protocol allowed attacker to inflate base value without corresponding adjustment of elastic value
---

## Description

The vulnerability stems from an intricate implementation of a RebaseToken mechanism in the Abracadabra protocol:

- The protocol used a [RebaseToken](https://github.com/boringcrypto/BoringSolidity/blob/78f4817d9c0d95fe9c45cd42e307ccd22cf5f4fc/contracts/libraries/BoringRebase.sol) with two key components:
  - Elastic value: Represents the actual assets in debt
  - Base value: Represents total borrowed shares

- The [`User borrow mapping`](https://github.com/Abracadabra-money/abracadabra-money-contracts/blob/cb97c71c8fbfecbd0080e0cfa877f2dc37f56950/src/cauldrons/CauldronV4.sol#L308) only stored borrowed shares per user, not the actual assets

- The design appeared to intentionally allow the protocol (or anyone) to modify the assets owed by users by changing the elastic value of the RebaseToken

- The [`repayForAll()`](https://github.com/Abracadabra-money/abracadabra-money-contracts/blob/cb97c71c8fbfecbd0080e0cfa877f2dc37f56950/src/cauldrons/CauldronV4.sol#L688) function made this feature accessible to everyone

**Attack Mechanism:**
1. A critical rounding error allowed the attacker to inflate the base value without correspondingly adjusting the elastic value
2. This rounding error only manifests when elastic and base values significantly deviate from each other
3. The [`repayForAll()`](https://github.com/Abracadabra-money/abracadabra-money-contracts/blob/cb97c71c8fbfecbd0080e0cfa877f2dc37f56950/src/cauldrons/CauldronV4.sol#L703) function was instrumental in creating this deviation

**Exploitation Steps:**
1. Inflate the base value (getting to elastic = 1, base = infinite)
2. Repay the outstanding assets (elastic = 0)
3. Leverage the [first depositor problem](https://github.com/boringcrypto/BoringSolidity/blob/78f4817d9c0d95fe9c45cd42e307ccd22cf5f4fc/contracts/libraries/BoringRebase.sol#L18), when elastic = 0, shares minted will be base = elastic
4. Borrow all assets in the protocol, because of first depositor problem, shares minted will be 1:1.
5. The attacker now has all assets in the protocol, but only owes a negligble share ratio to all outstanding shares.

**Vulnerability Details:**
- The solvency check [`_isSolvent()`](https://github.com/Abracadabra-money/abracadabra-money-contracts/blob/cb97c71c8fbfecbd0080e0cfa877f2dc37f56950/src/cauldrons/CauldronV4.sol#L203) relied on comparing the attacker's ratio of total borrowed shares
- The solvency check implicitly assumed elastic and base values would remain closely aligned
- With base set to infinite, the attacker's debt ratio becomes negligible


## Proposed Solution

Assuming the original implementation was well-intentioned but flawed, a simple invariant check could have prevented the attack:

```solidity
function assertionNoDebtSharesIfNoDebt() public view {
    if (elastic == 0) {
        require(base == 0, "No debt shares if no debt");
    }
}
```

This assertion ensures that when no assets are owed (elastic = 0), there should be no debt shares (base = 0), thereby preventing the exploit.
