title: Visor Finance Unrestricted Mint
description: Visor Finance allowed anyone to mint rewardTokens
---

This is a fairly simple bug that let anyone mint rewardTokens.

Background: https://x.com/storming0x/status/1473321779250802693

# Description

- The deposit function lets anyone mint rewardTokens if
  - the from address is a contract and has an owner and where msg.sender == owner
- It is intended that the from address sends the underlying token to this contract
  - But it does not check whether delegatedTransferERC20 is implemented correctly
  - it can be a noop
- The attacker can mint rewardTokens to himself

## Solution

While this is an obvious bug, an invariant could have prevented an exploit of the bug.

Invariant:

```solidity
function assertionIsSolvent() public view {
  require(visr.balanceOf(address(assertionAdopter)) >= vvisr.totalSupply(), "Reward tokens are undercollateralized");
}
```

Alternatively, the assertion could test the correct behavior of the previous transaction.
The assertion could be triggered by a call to the deposit function.

```solidity
function assertion_triggerDeposit_remainsSolvent() public view {

  uint256 postBalanceCollateral = visr.balanceOf(address(adopter));
  uint256 postTotalSupplyRewards = vvisr.totalSupply();
  uint256 postRatio = postBalanceCollateral / postTotalSupplyRewards;
  ph.forkPreState();

  uint256 preBalanceCollateral = visr.balanceOf(address(adopter));
  uint256 preTotalSupplyRewards = vvisr.totalSupply();
  uint256 preRatio = preBalanceCollateral / preTotalSupplyRewards;

  require(preRatio == postRatio, "Reward tokens are undercollateralized");
}
```
