title: 'Price Within Ticks'
description: 'Make sure that the price is within the tick range'

import ass15PriceWithinTicks from "/snippets/ass15-price-within-ticks.a.mdx";

## Use Case
In Automated Market Makers (AMMs), particularly those using concentrated liquidity models like Uniswap V3, the price is represented by ticks. A tick is a discrete unit of measurement for the price of an asset, and maintaining proper tick boundaries is critical for protocol security.

This assertion is particularly important for:
- Preventing price manipulation through tick boundary violations
- Ensuring trades execute at valid price points
- Maintaining protocol invariants around price representation
- Detecting potential exploits that could manipulate tick boundaries

For example, if an attacker could push the price outside the valid tick range, they could potentially:
- Execute trades at invalid prices
- Manipulate liquidity positions
- Cause protocol calculations to fail

### Applicable Protocols
- AMMs using concentrated liquidity models (e.g., Uniswap V3, PancakeSwap V3)
- Protocols that rely on tick-based price calculations
- DeFi protocols that interact with tick-based AMMs
- Cross-chain bridges that use tick-based price feeds

## Explanation
The assertion implements a focused approach to verify tick integrity:

1. **Tick Range Validation**:
   - Verifies that ticks stay within global bounds (-887272 to 887272)
   - Prevents tick manipulation outside valid ranges
   - Ensures the AMM's mathematical model remains valid

2. **Tick Spacing Alignment**:
   - Ensures ticks align with the pool's tick spacing
   - Maintains proper concentrated liquidity calculations
   - Prevents position management errors

The assertion uses the following cheatcodes and functions:
- `ph.forkPreState()`: Captures the initial tick state
- `ph.forkPostState()`: Captures the final tick state
- `registerStorageChangeTrigger()`: Monitors changes to tick-related storage slots

This focused approach ensures:
1. Ticks remain within protocol-defined bounds
2. Tick spacing rules are enforced
3. Core AMM functionality remains secure

For more information about cheatcodes, see the [Cheatcodes Documentation](/credible/cheatcodes).

## Code Example

> **Note:** This code example is maintained in the [Phylax Assertion Examples Repository](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/assertion-examples/blob/main/assertions/assertions_book/). For a full examples with mock protocol code and tests please refer to the repository.

## Testing
To test this assertion:

1. Deploy a mock Uniswap V3 pool contract
2. Create test scenarios that:
   - Execute trades within valid tick ranges
   - Attempt trades that would push ticks outside bounds
   - Test tick spacing alignment

## Assertion Best Practices
- Combine this assertion with other AMM-related assertions like [Fee Calculations](/assertions-book/assertions/ass14-fee-calculations)
- Consider protocol-specific parameters for:
  - Tick spacing requirements
  - Global tick bounds (if different from Uniswap V3)
