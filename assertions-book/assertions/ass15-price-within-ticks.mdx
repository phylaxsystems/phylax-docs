title: 'Price Within Ticks'
description: 'Make sure that the price is within the tick range'
---

## Use Case
In Automated Market Makers (AMMs), particularly those using concentrated liquidity models like Uniswap V3, the price is represented by ticks. A tick is a discrete unit of measurement for the price of an asset, and maintaining proper tick boundaries is critical for protocol security.

This assertion is particularly important for:
- Preventing price manipulation through tick boundary violations
- Ensuring trades execute at valid price points
- Maintaining protocol invariants around price representation
- Detecting potential exploits that could manipulate tick boundaries

For example, if an attacker could push the price outside the valid tick range, they could potentially:
- Execute trades at invalid prices
- Manipulate liquidity positions
- Cause protocol calculations to fail

### Applicable Protocols
- AMMs using concentrated liquidity models (e.g., Uniswap V3, PancakeSwap V3)
- Protocols that rely on tick-based price calculations
- DeFi protocols that interact with tick-based AMMs
- Cross-chain bridges that use tick-based price feeds

## Explanation
The assertion implements a focused approach to verify tick integrity:

1. **Tick Range Validation**:
   - Verifies that ticks stay within global bounds (-887272 to 887272)
   - Prevents tick manipulation outside valid ranges
   - Ensures the AMM's mathematical model remains valid

2. **Tick Spacing Alignment**:
   - Ensures ticks align with the pool's tick spacing
   - Maintains proper concentrated liquidity calculations
   - Prevents position management errors

The assertion uses the following cheatcodes:
- `forkPreState()`: Captures the initial tick state
- `forkPostState()`: Captures the final tick state
- `registerStorageChangeTrigger()`: Monitors changes to tick-related storage slots

This focused approach ensures:
1. Ticks remain within protocol-defined bounds
2. Tick spacing rules are enforced
3. Core AMM functionality remains secure

import {PhEvm} from "credible-std/PhEvm.sol";

// Uniswap v3 pool style interface
interface IUniswapV3Pool {
    function slot0()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint160 sqrtPriceX96,
            int24 tick,
            uint16 observationIndex,
            uint16 observationCardinality,
            uint16 observationCardinalityNext,
            uint8 feeProtocol,

    function tickSpacing() external view returns (int24);
}

contract PriceWithinTicksAssertion is Assertion {
    IUniswapV3Pool public pool;

    // Uniswap V3 tick bounds
    int24 constant MIN_TICK = -887272;
    int24 constant MAX_TICK = 887272;

    constructor(IUniswapV3Pool pool_) {
        pool = pool_;
    }

    function triggers() external view override {
        // Register trigger for changes to the tick storage slot
        // Assumes tick is stored in slot0 of the pool contract
        registerStorageChangeTrigger(this.priceWithinTicks.selector, bytes32(uint256(0)));
    }

    // Check that the price is within the tick bounds and that the tick is divisible by the tick spacing
    function priceWithinTicks() external {
        // Get pre-swap state
        ph.forkPreState();
        (, int24 preTick,,,,,) = pool.slot0();

        // Get post-swap state
        ph.forkPostState();
        (, int24 postTick,,,,,) = pool.slot0();
        int24 spacing = pool.tickSpacing();

        // Check 1: Tick must be within global bounds
        require(postTick >= MIN_TICK && postTick <= MAX_TICK, "Tick outside global bounds");

        // Check 2: Tick must be divisible by tickSpacing
        require(postTick % spacing == 0, "Tick not aligned with spacing");
    }
}
```

## Testing
To test this assertion:

1. Deploy a mock Uniswap V3 pool contract
2. Create test scenarios that:
   - Execute trades within valid tick ranges
   - Attempt trades that would push ticks outside bounds
   - Test tick spacing alignment

## Assertion Best Practices
- Combine this assertion with other AMM-related assertions like [Fee Calculations](/assertions-book/assertions/ass14-fee-calculations)
- Consider protocol-specific parameters for:
  - Tick spacing requirements
  - Global tick bounds (if different from Uniswap V3)
- Use detailed error messages to aid in debugging
