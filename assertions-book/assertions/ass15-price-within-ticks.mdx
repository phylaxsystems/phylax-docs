## Use Case

In some AMMs, the price is represented by a tick. A tick is a unit of measurement for the price of an asset. It is important to make sure that the price is within the tick range.

## Explanation

Check the exact boundaries of the tick range before and after a trade to make sure that the price is within the tick range.

## Code Example
