title: TWAP Deviation
description: Assert that the TWAP price doesn't deviate more than X% from the pre-state TWAP price

import ass11TwapDeviation from "/snippets/ass11-twap-deviation.a.mdx";

## Use Case
Check that the TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) reported by an oracle doesn't deviate more than X% from the pre-state TWAP price. This is a critical security parameter for DeFi protocols that rely on TWAP oracles for pricing assets, as sudden price deviations could indicate manipulation or oracle failure.

This assertion is particularly important for:
- Preventing price manipulation through flash loan attacks
- Ensuring oracle reliability and accuracy
- Protecting against oracle manipulation in lending protocols
- Maintaining protocol stability during market volatility
- Detecting potential oracle failures or attacks

For example, if a protocol allows a 5% deviation, an attacker could potentially manipulate prices within this range to extract value, making this a critical security parameter that requires careful consideration.

### Applicable Protocols
- AMMs and DEXs that use TWAP for price discovery
- Lending protocols that use TWAP for collateral valuation
- Yield aggregators that rely on TWAP for rebalancing
- Options protocols that use TWAP for settlement prices
- Cross-chain bridges that use TWAP for asset pricing

Each protocol type needs this assertion because:
- AMMs: Prevents price manipulation during large trades
- Lending: Ensures accurate collateral valuation for liquidations
- Yield: Maintains fair rebalancing prices
- Options: Guarantees fair settlement prices
- Bridges: Prevents cross-chain arbitrage attacks

## Explanation
The assertion monitors changes to the current price by comparing it against the TWAP price from before the transaction. It uses a two-stage approach to ensure price stability:

The assertion uses the following cheatcodes:
- `ph.forkPreState()`: Creates a fork of the state before the transaction to capture the TWAP price as our reference point
- `ph.forkPostState()`: Creates a fork of the state after the transaction to get the final price
- `getStateChangesUint()`: Gets all state changes for the current price to detect manipulation throughout the callstack
- `registerStorageChangeTrigger()`: Triggers the assertion when the price storage slot changes

The implementation performs two checks:
1. A comparison between the post-transaction price and the pre-transaction TWAP
2. Verification of all price changes during the transaction's execution

This multi-layered approach ensures that:
1. The current price remains within acceptable bounds of the pre-transaction TWAP
2. Any attempts to manipulate the price during the transaction are detected
3. The protocol's pricing mechanism cannot be exploited through flash loans or other attacks

## Testing
To test this assertion:
1. Deploy a mock pool contract with TWAP functionality
2. Set up test scenarios with various price movements
3. Verify the assertion catches deviations above the threshold
4. Test edge cases like zero prices and extreme values

## Assertion Best Practices
- Consider combining this assertion with other price-related assertions like [Intra-tx Oracle Deviation](/assertions-book/assertions/ass28-intra-tx-oracle-deviation) for comprehensive security
- Use the `getStateChangesUint` cheatcode to detect price manipulation throughout the callstack
- Consider implementing different deviation thresholds for different market conditions (eg. stablecoin pools vs volatile assets)
