## Use Case

Many DeFi protocols have functionality to pause or panic their protocols. This is useful in case of emergencies.
It's important to make sure that the protocol works as expected in panic state.

## Explanation
Check that it's not possible to deposit assets into the pool during panic state.

Withdrawals should still be possible, so we can allow transactions that decrease the balance of the pool.

## Code Example

pre: Get balances

post: Balance of the pool does not increase, but it can decrease (withdrawals)
