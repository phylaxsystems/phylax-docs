description: 'Make sure that pool works as expected in panic state'

## Use Case

Many DeFi protocols have functionality to pause or panic their protocols. This is useful in case of emergencies.
It's important to make sure that the protocol works as expected in panic state.

## Explanation
Check that it's not possible to deposit assets into the pool during panic state.

Withdrawals should still be possible, so we can allow transactions that decrease the balance of the pool.

## Code Example

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.28;

import {Assertion} from "../../lib/credible-std/Assertion.sol";

// Beefy style interface
interface IBeefyVault {
    function paused() external view returns (bool);
    function balance() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract BeefyPanicAssertion is Assertion {
    IBeefyVault public vault = IBeefyVault(address(0xbeef));

    function fnSelectors() external pure override returns (bytes4[] memory assertions) {
        assertions = new bytes4[](1); // Define the number of triggers
        assertions[0] = this.assertionPanickedCanOnlyDecreaseBalance.selector; // Define the trigger
    }

    // Check that if the state is panicked that the pool balance can only decrease
    // The tokens can increase in value, but the balance can only decrease
    // This is a more robust check as it doesn't rely on the function selectors
    function assertionPanickedCanOnlyDecreaseBalance() external {
        ph.forkPreState();
        bool isPanicked = vault.paused();
        uint256 preBalance = vault.balance();
        ph.forkPostState();
        uint256 postBalance = vault.balance();
        if (isPanicked) {
            require(postBalance <= preBalance, "Balance can only decrease when panicked");
        }
    }
}
```
