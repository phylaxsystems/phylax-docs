## Use Case
In AMMs and other DeFi protocols, trading fees are a critical security parameter that directly impacts user returns and protocol revenue. Unexpected fee changes can lead to:
- Unauthorized fee manipulation by malicious actors
- Protocol revenue loss through fee bypasses
- User losses from unexpected fee increases
- Market manipulation through fee changes

This assertion is particularly important because:
- Fees are a primary revenue source for many DeFi protocols
- Fee changes can be used as an attack vector to drain protocol value
- Users rely on consistent fee structures for trading strategies
- Protocol sustainability depends on predictable fee mechanisms

### Applicable Protocols
- AMMs (Automated Market Makers) like Velodrome, Aerodrome, and Curve
- DEX aggregators that charge routing fees
- Lending protocols with origination fees
- Yield aggregators with performance fees
- Cross-chain bridges with transfer fees

Each protocol type needs this assertion because:
- AMMs: Fee changes can be used to manipulate price impact and drain liquidity
- DEX aggregators: Fee manipulation could bypass routing security
- Lending protocols: Fee changes could affect interest calculations
- Yield aggregators: Performance fee changes could drain protocol value
- Bridges: Fee changes could be used to manipulate cross-chain arbitrage

## Explanation
The assertion uses a whitelist approach to control fee changes:

1. Trigger Registration:
   - Uses `registerStorageChangeTrigger` to detect any changes to the fee storage slot
   - When triggered, we know a fee change has occurred

2. Whitelist Validation:
   - Maintains hardcoded allowed fee values for both stable and non-stable pools
   - For stable pools: allows 0.1% (1) and 0.15% (15)
   - For non-stable pools: allows 0.25% (25) and 0.30% (30)
   - When a change occurs, verifies the new fee matches one of the allowed values
   - Prevents unauthorized fee modifications

The assertion uses the following cheatcodes and functions:
- `registerStorageChangeTrigger()`: Detects changes to the fee storage slot
- `ph.load()`: Retrieves the new fee value after a change
- `getStateChangesUint()`: Gets all state changes for the fee storage slot to verify intermediate changes

This approach ensures that:
1. Only whitelisted fee values are allowed
2. Protocol can still update fees through proper channels
3. Unauthorized fee modifications are prevented
4. All intermediate fee changes in the callstack are also validated

For more information about cheatcodes, see the [Cheatcodes Documentation](/credible/cheatcodes).

## Testing
To test this assertion:
1. Deploy the assertion contract with a test pool
2. Execute transactions that should maintain fees
3. Attempt transactions that would modify fees
4. Verify the assertion catches unauthorized changes

## Assertion Best Practices
- Use whitelists to explicitly define allowed fee values
