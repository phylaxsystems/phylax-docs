## Use Case

AMMs offer atomic swaps between assets.
Users can swap one asset for another at a given price.
It is crucial that the price is correct, otherwise users will not be able to trust the protocol.

## Explanation

Check that the amount of tokens received after a swap is correct according to the quoted price prior to the swap.

## Code Example

pre-state: Calculate the minimum amount of tokens that should be received after a swap

post-state: Check if the amount of tokens received is greater than the minimum amount

```solidity

```
