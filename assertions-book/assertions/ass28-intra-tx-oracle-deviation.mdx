title: Intra-tx Oracle Deviation
description: Assert that oracle price updates stay within an acceptable deviation range
---

import ass28IntraTxOracleDeviation from "/snippets/ass28-intra-tx-oracle-deviation.a.mdx";

## Use Case
This assertion monitors oracle price updates to detect and prevent price manipulation within a single transaction. Price oracles are critical security components that many DeFi protocols rely on for valuation, liquidations, and trading decisions. Intra-transaction price manipulations can lead to:

- Flash loan attacks that temporarily manipulate oracle prices
- Malicious arbitrage exploiting large price deviations
- Theft of funds through manipulated liquidations or swaps
- Protocol insolvency due to incorrect asset valuations

This assertion is particularly important for:
- Preventing price manipulation attacks that exploit multiple price updates
- Ensuring price stability across oracle updates within a transaction
- Protecting protocols from flash-loan based oracle attacks
- Maintaining protocol security by enforcing price deviation thresholds

### Applicable Protocols
- AMM-based DEXs that use oracle prices for various operations
- Lending protocols that rely on oracles for collateral valuation
- Synthetic asset platforms that need stable and accurate price feeds
- Derivatives protocols that use oracles for settlement prices
- Yield farming platforms that calculate rewards based on asset prices

These protocols need this assertion because:
- DEXs can be exploited through price manipulation to extract value
- Lending protocols need accurate price data to maintain proper collateralization
- Synthetic asset platforms require stable oracle prices to maintain peg
- Derivatives protocols depend on reliable pricing for fair settlement
- Yield platforms may miscalculate rewards with manipulated prices

## Explanation
The assertion implements a simple but effective approach to verify oracle price updates:

1. **Pre/Post State Comparison**:
   - Uses `forkPreState()` to capture the price before the transaction
   - Uses `forkPostState()` to capture the price after the transaction
   - Compares pre and post states to detect price deviations (reverts early if deviation is detected)

2. **Intra-Transaction Inspection**:
   - Uses `getCallInputs()` to capture all price update calls within the transaction 
   - Verifies each update's price parameter against the initial price
   - Enforces that no price update can deviate more than the maximum allowed percentage from the initial price

The assertion uses the following cheatcodes:
- `forkPreState()`: Captures the oracle price before any updates
- `forkPostState()`: Captures the oracle price after all updates
- `getCallInputs()`: Monitors all price update function calls within the transaction
- `registerCallTrigger()`: Triggers the assertion when an oracle price update is detected

This approach ensures that:
1. Oracle prices remain within an acceptable deviation range throughout a transaction
2. Flash loan attacks attempting to manipulate prices are detected and prevented
3. Both the final price and any intermediate price updates are validated against the initial price

## Testing
To test this assertion:

1. Deploy a test oracle contract with price update functionality
2. Create test scenarios with varying price update patterns:
   - Single price updates with different deviation amounts
   - Multiple price updates within acceptable ranges
   - Multiple price updates with excessive deviations
   - Flash loan-style attacks with price manipulation
3. Verify the assertion correctly:
   - Allows updates within acceptable deviation thresholds
   - Blocks updates exceeding deviation thresholds
   - Detects suspicious patterns of sequential updates

## Assertion Best Practices
- Adjust the `MAX_DEVIATION_PERCENTAGE` based on the specific asset's volatility
- Combine with [Oracle Validation](/assertions-book/assertions/ass10-oracle-validation) for comprehensive oracle protection
- Consider implementing time-weighted average prices (TWAP) in volatile markets
- Add specific detection for sandwich patterns (price up then down, or vice versa)
- Monitor transaction origin to detect potential flash loan sources
- Consider different thresholds for different assets or market conditions
