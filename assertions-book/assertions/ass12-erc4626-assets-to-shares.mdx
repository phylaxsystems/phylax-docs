title: ERC4626 Assets to Shares
description: Make sure that the total shares are not more than the total assets
---

## Use Case
ERC4626 is a standard for creating yield-bearing tokens that are compatible with ERC20. It is used in many DeFi protocols.
In ERC4626, there is an invariant that the total shares are not more than the total assets. This is a common requirement for ERC4626 compliant protocols.

## Explanation
This assertion makes sure that the total shares are not more than the total assets. It also handles the edge case where the total shares are 0.

## Code Example
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.28;

import {Assertion} from "../../lib/credible-std/src/Assertion.sol";

interface IERC4626 {
    function totalAssets() external view returns (uint256);

    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    function convertToShares(uint256 assets) external view returns (uint256);
}

// Checks that the total shares are not more than the total assets
contract ERC4626AssetsSharesAssertion is Assertion {
    IERC4626 public erc4626 = IERC4626(address(0xbeef));

    function fnSelectors() external pure override returns (bytes4[] memory assertions) {
        assertions = new bytes4[](1);
        assertions[0] = this.assertionAssetsShares.selector;
    }

    // Make sure that the total shares are not more than the total assets
    // revert if total shares is greater than total assets
    function assertionAssetsShares() external {
        ph.forkPostState();
        uint256 totalAssets = erc4626.totalAssets();
        uint256 totalShares = erc4626.totalSupply();
        uint256 totalAssetsInShares = erc4626.convertToShares(totalAssets);
        require(totalAssetsInShares >= totalShares, "Total shares is greater than total assets");
    }
}
```
