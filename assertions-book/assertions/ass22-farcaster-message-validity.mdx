---

## Use Case
Farcaster is a social media platform that allows users to post messages to a decentralized network.
Although it's not a DeFi protocol with a lot of funds at stake, it's still important to make sure that messages are valid and usernames are unique.

## Explanation
Check that a message is valid by checking the signature of the message as well as making sure content size limits are respected etc.

## Code Example

```solidity

```

- Pre-state: Record message chain state
- Post-state: After message creation:
    - Signature validity
    - Parent message existence for replies
    - Content size limits respected
    - Rate limits enforced
