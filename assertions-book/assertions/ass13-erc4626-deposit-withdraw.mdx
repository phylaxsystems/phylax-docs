## Use Case
ERC4626 is a standard for creating yield-bearing tokens that are compatible with ERC20. This assertion collection ensures that deposit and withdrawal operations maintain correct accounting for both assets and shares, which are critical security parameters for any ERC4626 vault.

This assertion collection is particularly important for:
- Preventing share calculation errors that could lead to loss of user funds
- Ensuring deposits and withdrawals maintain the correct ratio between assets and shares
- Detecting potential accounting errors in yield-bearing vaults
- Maintaining protocol security by enforcing share calculation invariants
- Verifying round-trip operations (deposit followed by withdrawal) preserve value
- Ensuring that share value never decreases unexpectedly (share value monotonicity)

For example, if a vault incorrectly calculates shares during deposits or withdrawals, users could receive fewer shares or assets than they should, effectively losing value.

### Applicable Protocols
- Yield aggregators that use ERC4626 for their vaults (e.g., Yearn, Aave, Compound)
- Lending protocols that implement ERC4626 for their interest-bearing tokens
- Liquidity pools that use ERC4626 for their LP tokens
- Staking protocols that implement ERC4626 for their staking tokens

## Explanation
The assertion collection is split into five separate assertion functions to ensure comprehensive verification of deposit and withdrawal operations:

### Deposit Assertions
1. **Deposit Asset Accounting**: Verifies that the total assets in the vault increase by exactly the amount deposited. This ensures that no assets are lost or duplicated during deposits.

2. **Deposit Share Accounting**: Verifies that each depositor receives the correct number of shares for their deposit. This is done by comparing the actual shares received with the expected shares calculated by `previewDeposit()`.

### Withdrawal Assertions
3. **Withdrawal Asset Accounting**: Verifies that the total assets in the vault decrease by exactly the amount withdrawn. This ensures that no assets are lost or unexpectedly gained during withdrawals.

4. **Withdrawal Share Accounting**: Verifies that the correct number of shares are burned for each withdrawal. This is done by comparing the actual shares burned with the expected shares calculated by `previewWithdraw()`.

### Share Value Assertion
5. **Share Value Monotonicity**: Verifies that the value of shares (measured in underlying assets) never decreases unexpectedly. This ensures that yield accrual is working correctly and there is no unauthorized value extraction. For a complete implementation, this assertion would need to be extended with custom logic to handle legitimate cases where share value might decrease, such as fee collection or investment losses.

The assertion collection uses the following cheatcodes and functions:
- `ph.getCallInputs()`: Retrieves the input data from all deposit or withdraw calls that triggered the assertion functions
- `ph.forkPreState()`: Creates a fork of the state before the operation to capture initial balances
- `ph.forkPostState()`: Creates a fork of the state after the operation to verify that the actual changes match the expected changes
- `registerCallTrigger()`: Sets up the assertion functions to be triggered whenever deposit or withdraw calls are made to the ERC4626 vault

For more information about cheatcodes, see the [Cheatcodes Documentation](/credible/cheatcodes).

This multi-layered approach ensures that:
1. Total assets are correctly updated after deposits and withdrawals
2. Share calculations are accurate and consistent with the preview functions
3. User balances are properly incremented or decremented with the correct share amount
4. The ERC4626 vault maintains its invariants during all operations
5. Share value either remains the same or increases over time (except during expected fee events or losses)

The assertion functions specifically check that there is no discrepancy between what the preview functions predict and what actually happens during the operations. This is critical because any mismatch could lead to users receiving incorrect amounts of shares or assets, potentially resulting in loss of value.

## Testing
To test this assertion collection:
1. Deploy an ERC4626 vault with known asset and share calculation logic
2. Perform deposits and withdrawals with various asset amounts
3. Verify that all assertion functions correctly identify any discrepancies:
   - Between total assets before and after operations
   - Between preview calculations and actual shares/assets received
   - In share value changes over time
4. Test edge cases like:
   - Zero deposits and withdrawals
   - Maximum deposits and withdrawals
   - Deposits followed immediately by withdrawals (round-trip operations)
   - Withdrawals with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Assertion Best Practices
- Use all five assertion functions together for comprehensive security verification
- The asset accounting checks are simpler and can fail fast if there's an issue
- The share accounting checks provide detailed verification of calculation accuracy
- The share value monotonicity assertion catches subtle issues that might not be detected by the other assertions
- Consider adding additional checks for:
  - Round-trip operations (deposit followed by withdrawal)
  - Rounding errors in share calculations
  - Fee calculations if the vault charges fees
  - Slippage protection based on preview functions

## ERC4626 Compliance Requirements
The ERC4626 standard requires several invariants to be maintained:
1. `convertToShares(convertToAssets(x)) <= x` - Converting assets to shares and back should never create value
2. `previewDeposit` must return the same value as the actual deposit operation
3. `previewWithdraw` must return the same value as the actual withdraw operation
4. Asset accounting must be exact - total assets must correctly reflect deposits and withdrawals
5. Share value should generally increase or stay the same as the vault accrues yield, except during explicit fee collections or loss events

These assertion functions verify compliance with these requirements, helping to ensure the vault operates correctly according to the standard.
