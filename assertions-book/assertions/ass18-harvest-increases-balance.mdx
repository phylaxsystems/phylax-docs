title: 'Harvest Increases Balance'
description: 'Make sure that the balance increases after a harvest'
---

## Use Case

In DeFi yield farming protocols, users can deposit assets into a pool and earn rewards.
The process of claiming the compounded rewards is called "harvesting".
It's expected that the balance of a vault is higher after a harvest.

## Explanation

Check that the balance of a vault is higher after a harvest and that the price per share doesn't decrease.

## Code Example

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.28;

import {Assertion} from "../../lib/credible-std/Assertion.sol";

// TODO: Import the contract / interface you want to assert against
interface IBeefyVault {
    function balance() external view returns (uint256);
    function getPricePerFullShare() external view returns (uint256);
    function harvest() external;
}

// Assert that the balance of the vault increases after a harvest
// Inspired by // https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-contracts/blob/master/forge/test/vault/ChainVaultsTest.t.sol#L77-L110
contract BeefyHarvestAssertion is Assertion {
    IBeefyVault public vault = IBeefyVault(address(0xbeef));

    bytes4 constant HARVEST = IBeefyVault.harvest.selector;

    function fnSelectors() external pure override returns (bytes4[] memory assertions) {
        assertions = new bytes4[](1); // Define the number of triggers
        assertions[0] = this.assertionHarvestIncreasesBalance.selector; // Define the trigger
    }

    // Assert that the balance of the vault increases after a harvest and that the price per share increases or stays the same
    function assertionHarvestIncreasesBalance() external {
        (,,, bytes memory data) = ph.getData(); // TODO; Fix once implemented
        bytes4 selector = bytes4(data[:4]);

        // Only check harvest calls
        if (selector != HARVEST) {
            return;
        }
        ph.forkPreState();
        uint256 preBalance = vault.balance();
        uint256 prePricePerShare = vault.getPricePerFullShare();

        ph.forkPostState();
        uint256 postBalance = vault.balance();
        uint256 postPricePerShare = vault.getPricePerFullShare();

        // Balance should increase after harvest
        require(postBalance > preBalance, "Harvest did not increase balance");

        // Price per share should increase or stay the same
        require(postPricePerShare >= prePricePerShare, "Price per share decreased after harvest");
    }
}
```
