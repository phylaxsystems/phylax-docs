title: Timelock Verification
description: Make sure that a timelock has been correctly triggered for governance actions

import ass9TimelockVerification from "/snippets/ass9-timelock-verification.a.mdx";

## Use Case
Timelocks are a governance mechanism in DeFi protocols that enforce a delay between when a governance action is proposed and when it can be executed. This delay allows the community to review and react to potentially harmful changes.

This assertion prevents:
- Bypassing the timelock mechanism
- Setting timelock delays that are too short
- Changing the timelock admin without proper authorization
- Executing governance actions before the timelock period has expired

This is important because:
- Timelocks provide a buffer against malicious governance actions
- Without proper enforcement, changes could be executed immediately
- Effective timelock periods need to be of appropriate duration

### Applicable Protocols
- DeFi lending protocols that use timelocks for parameter updates
- DEX protocols that require timelocked governance for pool parameter changes
- Yield aggregators that use timelocks for strategy updates
- Cross-chain bridges that implement timelocks for security parameters
- DAOs that use timelocks for treasury management and protocol upgrades

Each of these protocol types relies on timelocks to:
- Prevent flash loan attacks through parameter manipulation
- Allow community review of significant protocol changes
- Protect against governance attacks
- Ensure proper security review periods for critical updates

## Explanation
The assertion verifies timelock integrity by:

1. **Pre-state Verification**
   - Captures the initial timelock state before any changes
   - Records whether the timelock is currently active

2. **Post-state Analysis**
   - Compares the final timelock state after changes
   - Verifies that any changes maintain security parameters

3. **Parameter Validation**
   - Ensures timelock delay is within acceptable bounds (1 day to 2 weeks)
   - Confirms timelock activation follows proper procedures

The assertion uses these cheatcodes:
- `forkPreState()`: Captures the initial timelock state
- `forkPostState()`: Analyzes the final timelock state
- `registerStorageChangeTrigger()`: Monitors changes to the timelock storage slot

The implementation performs checks on:
1. The timelock's active status before and after the transaction
2. The timelock delay parameters when the timelock is activated

This ensures that:
- Timelock activations use appropriate delay periods
- Security parameters are maintained during governance changes
- Protocol changes follow proper governance procedures

## Testing
To test this assertion:
1. Deploy a mock governance contract with timelock functionality
2. Create test cases for:
   - Valid timelock activation with proper parameters
   - Invalid timelock activation with too short delay
   - Attempts to bypass timelock entirely
3. Verify the assertion correctly identifies valid and invalid states

## Assertion Best Practices
- Combine this assertion with [Owner Change](/assertions-book/assertions/ass05-ownership-change) for comprehensive governance security
- Use appropriate delay bounds based on your protocol's risk profile
