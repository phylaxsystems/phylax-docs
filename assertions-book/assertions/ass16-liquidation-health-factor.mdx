title: 'Liquidation Health Factor'
description: 'Make sure that liquidations can only happen if the position is unhealthy'

import ass16LiquidationHealthFactor from "/snippets/ass16-liquidation-health-factor.a.mdx";

## Use Case
In DeFi lending protocols, positions can be liquidated when they become unhealthy due to market movements or other factors. The health factor is a critical security parameter that determines when a position can be liquidated. An incorrect health factor calculation or validation could lead to:

- Unauthorized liquidations of healthy positions
- Loss of user funds through forced liquidations
- Protocol insolvency if positions can't be liquidated when needed
- Market manipulation through targeted liquidations

This assertion is particularly important for:
- Preventing liquidations of positions that are still healthy
- Ensuring liquidations only occur when necessary for protocol solvency
- Protecting users from unfair liquidations
- Maintaining protocol stability by enforcing proper liquidation thresholds

### Applicable Protocols
- Lending protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound, Morpho) where positions can be liquidated
- Margin trading platforms that require position health monitoring
- Perpetual futures protocols with liquidation mechanisms
- Any DeFi protocol that uses health factors to determine position solvency

These protocols need this assertion because:
- Lending protocols rely on liquidations to maintain solvency
- Margin trading platforms need precise health factor calculations
- Perpetual futures protocols use liquidations for risk management
- Incorrect liquidation logic could lead to significant protocol losses

## Explanation
The assertion implements a multi-layered approach to verify liquidation health factors:

1. **Pre-liquidation Check**:
   - Uses `forkPreState()` to capture the health factor before liquidation
   - Verifies the position is actually unhealthy (below liquidation threshold)
   - Prevents liquidations of healthy positions

2. **Post-liquidation Validation**:
   - Uses `forkPostState()` to verify the health factor after liquidation
   - Ensures the health factor improves after liquidation
   - Confirms the position meets minimum health requirements

3. **Parameter Validation**:
   - Uses `getCallInputs()` to monitor liquidation function calls
   - Validates that seized assets and repaid shares are non-zero
   - Enforces a maximum liquidation amount to prevent protocol destabilization
   - Ensures liquidation parameters are within safe bounds

The assertion uses the following cheatcodes and functions:
- `ph.forkPreState()`: Captures the health factor before liquidation
- `ph.forkPostState()`: Verifies the health factor after liquidation
- `ph.getCallInputs()`: Monitors liquidation function calls
- `registerCallTrigger()`: Triggers on liquidation function calls

This approach ensures that:
1. Only unhealthy positions can be liquidated
2. Liquidations improve the position's health
3. The protocol maintains proper risk management
4. Liquidation amounts are within safe limits

## Testing
To test this assertion:

1. Deploy a test instance of the lending protocol
2. Create positions with varying health factors
3. Attempt liquidations on both healthy and unhealthy positions
4. Verify the assertion correctly:
   - Prevents liquidations of healthy positions
   - Allows liquidations of unhealthy positions
   - Ensures health factor improvement after liquidation

## Assertion Best Practices
- Combine with other assertions like [ERC20 Drain](/assertions-book/assertions/ass20-erc20-drain) for comprehensive protection
- Use appropriate health factor thresholds based on protocol risk parameters
