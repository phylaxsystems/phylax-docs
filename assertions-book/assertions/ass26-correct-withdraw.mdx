title: 'Correct Withdraw'
description: 'Make sure that a user cannot withdraw more than they should'

## Use Case

Users being able to withdraw assets from DeFi protocols is the bread and butter of DeFi.
Users are willing to deposit assets into DeFi protocols because they can withdraw them at a later point in time, hopefully with a profit.
Making sure that users cannot withdraw more than they should is crucial for the protocol to function correctly.
If an attacker has found a way to withdraw more than they should due to a bug, it can be disastrous for the protocol.
An assertions that checks that amounts withdrawn are always correct can save the protocol.

## Explanation

Check that the amount withdrawn from a given protocol is always correct.

## Code Example

pre-state: Calculate the amount that a user should be able to withdraw

post-state: Check if the amount withdrawn is correct
