title: 'Correct Withdraw'
description: 'Make sure that a user cannot withdraw more than they should'

## Use Case

Users being able to withdraw assets from DeFi protocols is the bread and butter of DeFi.
Users are willing to deposit assets into DeFi protocols because they can withdraw them at a later point in time, hopefully with a profit.
Making sure that users cannot withdraw more than they should is crucial for the protocol to function correctly.
If an attacker has found a way to withdraw more than they should due to a bug, it can be disastrous for the protocol.
An assertions that checks that amounts withdrawn are always correct can save the protocol.

## Explanation

Check that the amount withdrawn from a given protocol is always correct.

pragma solidity 0.8.28;

import {Assertion} from "../../lib/credible-std/Assertion.sol";

interface IYieldFarm {
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
    function userInfo(address user) external view returns (uint256 depositAmount, uint256 rewards);
}

contract YieldFarmWithdrawAssertion is Assertion {
    IYieldFarm public farm = IYieldFarm(address(0xbeef));

    function fnSelectors() external pure override returns (bytes4[] memory assertions) {
        assertions = new bytes4[](1);
        assertions[0] = bytes4(keccak256("withdraw(uint256)"));
    }

    // Make sure the withdraw amount is less than or equal to the deposit amount
    // We don't want anyone to be able to withdraw more than they should be able to
    // We're assuming that that rewards are accounted for separately
    function assertWithdraw() external {
        ph.forkPreState();
        // Get withdrawal amount from transaction data
        (address user,,, bytes memory data) = ph.getData(); // TODO: Update when cheatcode is implemented
        uint256 withdrawAmount = abi.decode(data[4:], (uint256));

        // Get pre-withdrawal state
        (uint256 preDeposit,) = farm.userInfo(user);

        require(withdrawAmount <= preDeposit, "Withdraw exceeds deposit");

        // Check post-withdrawal state
        ph.forkPostState();
        (uint256 postDeposit,) = farm.userInfo(user);

        // Verify deposit amount decreased correctly
        require(postDeposit == preDeposit - withdrawAmount, "Incorrect withdrawal amount");
    }
}
