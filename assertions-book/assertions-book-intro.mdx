title: Introduction to the Assertions Book
description: Resource for assertion use cases and patterns
---

This resource is a collection of use cases and patterns for assertions. The goal is to show how assertions can be used to prevent hacks and vulnerabilities in smart contracts and protocols.
The content of the book is a great source for inspiration for how to write assertions for your own use cases and protocols.

Each entry in the book shows a code snippet of an assertion. Each assertion is accompanied by a minimal interface for the protocol the assertion is written for.
Full examples that include mock protocol code and test cases are available in the [Phylax Assertion Examples Repository](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/assertion-examples).

## Getting Started
It's a good idea to check out the two links below to get started with assertions, but it's not required to understand the content of the book.

- Learn all about assertions in the [Assertion Guide](/credible/pcl-assertion-guide)
- Follow the [PCL Quickstart Guide](/credible/pcl-quickstart) to set up your own assertions project
- Check the [PhEVM Cheatcodes Reference](/credible/cheatcodes) for available assertion tools

If you have questions or issues, please reach out on telegram [@phylax_credible_layer](https://t.me/phylax_credible_layer).

If you think an assertion is missing, please don't hesitate to open a PR or reach out. We love digging into new hacks and use cases and writing assertions for them!

## Table of Contents

### Access Control & Administrative Changes

- [**Implementation Address Change**](/assertions-book/assertions/ass01-impl-addr-change.mdx): Protects against unauthorized changes to proxy implementation addresses, preventing attackers from replacing contract logic with malicious code.

- [**Owner Change**](/assertions-book/assertions/ass05-ownership-change.mdx): Ensures ownership of a contract cannot be transferred unexpectedly, preventing attackers from gaining administrative control over critical protocol functions.

TODO: When all assertions examples are updated and merged, add a small description of each assertion here, linking to the example and categorizing them by use case.
