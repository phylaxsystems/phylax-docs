description: 'Understanding ownership verification requirements for the Credible Layer'
---

To add a contract or register an assertion in the Credible Layer, users must prove they are the admin or owner of that contract. Currently, this is done through the `getOwner()` function exposed by the Ownable pattern.

## Current Requirements

The Credible Layer currently requires contracts to implement the `getOwner()` function to verify ownership. This is a temporary requirement while we work on implementing more flexible verification methods. We are actively researching ways to make this as flexible as possible without compromising security.

<Note>
For now while developing and getting familiar with assertions you should make sure to use the Ownable pattern in your contracts to make sure they are compatible.
</Note>

## Future Improvements

We are actively working on expanding the verification methods to support:

- Multisig wallets
- Governance contracts
- Custom ownership patterns

## Known Limitations

- Some contracts are fully permissionless and do not have an owner. In this case the Credible Layer will currently not be able to verify ownership.
