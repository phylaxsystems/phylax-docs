# Ownership Verification

The current version of the Credible Layer requires that the address returned by the `owner()` function of a contract is the only address that can register that contract and add assertions to it. This is a temporary implementation that will be expanded in future versions.

## Current Implementation

The Credible Layer expects contracts to implement the `owner()` function, typically through the Ownable pattern. Here's an example of the expected interface:

```solidity
interface IOwnable {
    function owner() external view returns (address);
}
```

When testing or developing with the Credible Layer, ensure your contracts implement this interface to enable project registration and assertion management.

## Future Development

We are actively researching alternative ownership verification methods that will:

- Support different ownership patterns
- Enable seamless ownership transfers
- Maintain security requirements
- Allow for multisig integration

These improvements will be implemented in future versions of the Credible Layer.
