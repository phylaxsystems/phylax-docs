The PCL (Phylax Credible Layer) CLI is a command-line tool for interacting with the Phylax Credible Layer.

## Prerequisites

Before installing PCL, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** (version 1.86 nightly or later)
- **Git**

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phylaxsystems/pcl
   cd pcl
   ```

2. Build the CLI:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. The compiled binaries will be available in the `target/release` directory. PCL relies on two main binaries:
   - `pcl`: The main CLI tool
   - `phorge`: A supporting binary required for PCL functionality

4. (Optional) Add the binaries to your PATH for easier access:
   ```bash
   # System-wide installation (requires admin privileges)
   cp target/release/pcl /usr/local/bin/
   cp target/release/phorge /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Or for a user-local installation
   cp target/release/pcl ~/.local/bin/
   cp target/release/phorge ~/.local/bin/
   ```

   You can place these binaries in any directory that's in your PATH. Choose a location that works best for your system configuration.

### Option 2: Download Pre-built Binary

Pre-built binaries are available for download from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/pcl/releases).

1. Download the appropriate binary for your platform.

2. Make the binaries executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x pcl
   chmod +x phorge
   ```

**Note:** The binaries might have slightly different names depending on the platform.
For example, on Linux, they might be named `pcl-aarch64-apple` and `phorge-aarch64-apple`.

3. Move the binaries to a location in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # System-wide installation (requires admin privileges)
   mv pcl /usr/local/bin/
   mv phorge /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Or for a user-local installation
   mv pcl ~/.local/bin/
   mv phorge ~/.local/bin/
   ```

## Verifying Installation

To verify that PCL is installed correctly, run:

```bash
pcl --version
```

You should see the version number of the installed PCL CLI.

## Next Steps

Now that you have PCL installed, you can learn how to [get started](/credible/pcl-quickstart) with the Credible Layer.
