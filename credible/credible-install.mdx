The `pcl` (Phylax Credible Layer) CLI is a command-line tool for interacting with the Phylax Credible Layer.

## Prerequisites

Before installing PCL, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust Nightly** (version 1.80 or later)
- **Git**

## Installation

### Option 1: Install with Cargo (Recommended)

The fastest and easiest way to install `pcl` is using Cargo:

```bash
cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/phylaxsystems/pcl --locked
```

This will install the `pcl` binary in your Cargo installation directory (typically `~/.cargo/bin` on Unix-like systems). Make sure this directory is in your PATH.

### Option 2: Build from Source

This option is recommended if you want more control over the build process or prefer to build from source.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phylaxsystems/pcl
   cd pcl
   ```

2. Build the CLI:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. The compiled binary will be available in the `target/release` directory.

4. (Optional) Add the binary to your PATH for easier access:
   ```bash
   # System-wide installation (requires admin privileges)
   cp target/release/pcl /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Or for a user-local installation
   cp target/release/pcl ~/.local/bin/
   ```

   You can place the binary in any directory that's in your PATH. Choose a location that works best for your system configuration.

   Alternatively, you can create an alias in your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) that points to the absolute path of the binary:
   ```bash
   # Add to your shell config file
   alias pcl="/path/to/pcl/target/release/pcl"
   ```

### Option 3: Download Pre-built Binary

Pre-built binaries are available for download from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/pcl/releases).

1. Download the appropriate binary for your platform.

2. Make the binary executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x pcl
   ```

**Note:** The binary might have a slightly different name depending on the platform.
For example, on Mac, it might be named `pcl-aarch64-apple`.

3. Move the binary to a location in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # System-wide installation (requires admin privileges)
   mv pcl /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Or for a user-local installation
   mv pcl ~/.local/bin/
   ```

## Verifying Installation

To verify that `pcl` is installed correctly, run:

```bash
pcl --version
```

You should see the version number of the installed `pcl` CLI.

## Next Steps
