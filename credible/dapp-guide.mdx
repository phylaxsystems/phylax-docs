title: DApp Overview
description: An overview of the Credible Layer dApp features and functionality
---

The Credible Layer dApp provides a comprehensive interface for managing smart contract projects and their associated assertions. It serves as the primary platform for:
- Creating and managing projects
- Linking and managing assertions
- Monitoring assertion status and insights
- Exploring projects and their security measures

The dApp's explorer feature enables users to quickly assess a project's security posture by viewing its linked assertions before interacting with it.

In this overview we'll walk through the process of authenticating with the dApp, creating a project and linking assertions to it.

## Prerequisites

A local development environment with the Credible Layer CLI (`pcl`) installed. If you don't have one set up yet, you can follow the [pcl quickstart guide](/credible/pcl-quickstart) to get started.

## Core Features

### Project Explorer
The dApp's explorer feature enables users to search for and analyze projects and their associated assertions. To access the explorer and see details about projects:
1. Click the "Explorer" tab in the navigation bar
2. Browse all projects on the Credible Layer
3. Search for specific projects by name or address
4. View detailed information about linked assertions

### Project Management

#### Creating a Project
To create a new project:
1. Navigate to the "Projects" tab
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Enter project details:
   - Project Name (typically matching your smart contract/protocol)
   - Project Description
   - Target Chain
4. Click "Continue to contract selection"
5. Add one or more contract addresses
    - Here it's important to note that only contracts where the `owner` matches the address of the account you're using to create the project will be permitted to be linked to the project.
    - Specifically this is done by calling the `owner()` function on the contract and comparing the result to the address of the account you're using to create the project.
6. Review and publish the project

<Note>
    Only the owner of a contract can create a project for it. There will be additional verification methods in the future, but for now this is the only way.
    When playing around and testing the demo, make sure to have an `owner()` function in your contract that returns the current owner.
</Note>

#### Linking Assertions
To link assertions to your project:
1. Store the assertion using the CLI:
   ```bash
   pcl store <assertion-name> <constructor-args>
   ```
2. Submit the assertion to your project:
   ```bash
   pcl submit -a '<assertion-name>(constructor-args)' -p <project-name>
   ```
3. In the dApp:
   - Navigate to your project dashboard
   - Go to "Ready for Submission" tab
   - Click "Proceed to Review"
   - Select target contract
   - Review and deploy the assertion

### Authentication
Before using the dApp, you must authenticate through the `pcl` CLI:
1. Run the authentication command:
   ```bash
   pcl auth login
   ```
2. Follow the provided login link
3. Connect your wallet
4. Enter the login code from the CLI
