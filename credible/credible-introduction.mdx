# The Phylax Credible Layer

The Phylax Credible Layer is a powerful security protocol that enhances blockchain applications without requiring any modifications to your existing smart contracts. It provides a non-invasive layer of protection that allows developers to define security rules and conditions that operate alongside their dApps, preventing potentially harmful operations before they occur.

## Core Concept: Credible Computing

At its core, the Credible Layer allows dApps to define states they don't want to reach, and proactively prevent those states from being reached—all without changing a single line of your original contract code.

- **Non-invasive**: Works alongside your existing smart contracts without requiring modifications
- **Deterministic**: Assertions produce consistent results for the same transaction and state
- **Transparent**: All assertion code is public and can be audited on-chain
- **Preventative**: Assertions block transactions that would violate security invariants

## Understanding Assertions

Assertions are the fundamental building blocks of the Credible Layer's security model:

- **What Are Assertions?** Assertions are separate Solidity files that define conditions and rules for transaction validation. They allow developers to maintain protocol invariants and implement custom security logic without altering their core contract code.

- **How They Work**: When a transaction interacts with a dApp's contract, assertions are run by the block builder of the rollup, which simulates whether the incoming transaction would violate any of the defined assertion conditions. This happens before transaction finalization, adding a protective layer around your existing contracts.

- **Flexibility and Power**: Assertions go beyond simple invariant checking. They can be used to implement complex security rules such as:
  - Maintaining critical protocol invariants (e.g., ensuring total assets ≥ total liabilities)
  - Defining whitelists or blacklists for address interactions
  - Implementing custom transaction validation logic
  - Creating context-aware security rules that adapt to different scenarios

- **Prevention vs. Detection**: Unlike traditional security methods that detect issues after they occur, assertions prevent problematic transactions from being finalized if they violate specified conditions.

Example assertion code:

```solidity
// This function is used to check if the owner of a contract has changed
// If the owner has changed during the transaction, the transaction will be reverted
function assertionOwnerChange() external {
    ph.forkPreState(); // fork the pre state - the state before the transaction
    address preOwner = ownership.owner(); // get the owner before the transaction
    ph.forkPostState(); // fork the post state - the state after the transaction
    address postOwner = ownership.owner(); // get the owner after the transaction
    require(preOwner == postOwner, "Owner changed");
}
```

### The Power of Assertions

The power of assertions is multifaceted:

1. **Protocol Safety**: Developers can ensure that critical protocol invariants are always maintained, preventing the system from entering unsafe states.

2. **Custom Security Logic**: Assertions allow for implementing tailored security measures, such as restricting certain operations to specific addresses or time periods.

3. **Block-Level Security**: Since assertions are evaluated for every relevant transaction, teams can programmatically define the behavior they want to exclude from their protocols with greater specificity and precision than relying on heuristic approaches.

4. **Integration Confidence**: There is significant time and resource savings for protocols needing to trust another smart contract for integration. For example, a DeFi yield aggregation service that integrates strategies across various markets and pools can use assertions to assess the risk and competence of the protocols they are collaborating with.

5. **Zero Contract Modifications**: Implement sophisticated security measures without changing your existing contract code, eliminating the need for audits or migrations of your core contracts.

## Key Components

The Credible Layer consists of several integrated components:

### 1. Assertion Protocol

The foundation of the Credible Layer is its protocol for making and verifying assertions about blockchain state. This allows applications to:

- Define precise security conditions that must be maintained
- Implement custom transaction validation logic
- Create flexible rules that adapt to different contexts

### 2. Verification System

A robust system that:
- Observes and validates blockchain transactions against assertions
- Ensures transactions do not violate defined conditions
- Provides guarantees that security rules are enforced

### 3. Developer SDK

The Credible SDK provides developers with:
- Easy-to-use interfaces for integrating with the Credible Layer
- Libraries for creating and verifying assertions
- Tools for developing and testing security conditions

## Benefits for Different Stakeholders

### For Developers

- **Non-invasive Security**: Add security measures without changing your existing smart contracts
- **Enhanced Protection**: Create robust security guarantees for your applications
- **Simplified Implementation**: Write assertions instead of building complex security monitoring systems
- **Reduced Risk**: Prevent security issues before they cause damage
- **Familiar Interface**: Use familiar Solidity syntax and tools for writing assertions
- **Better Sleep**: No more worrying about security issues in your smart contracts

### For Users

- **Greater Trust**: Confidence that applications are operating securely
- **Transparency**: Visibility into security assertions and verifications
- **Protection**: Transactions that would violate security conditions are rejected

### For the Ecosystem

- **Improved Security Standards**: Raises the bar for blockchain security practices
- **Safer Integrations**: Protocols can trust other protocols through verified assertions
- **Innovation**: Enables new types of secure applications and use cases

## Use Cases

The Credible Layer can be applied to a wide range of blockchain applications:

- **DeFi Protocols**: Validate transaction integrity and prevent manipulation attempts
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Verify authenticity and ownership of digital assets
- **DAOs**: Ensure governance processes follow established rules
- **Protocol Integrations**: Verify the safety of integrating with other smart contracts
- **Access Control**: Implement sophisticated whitelisting or blacklisting mechanisms
- **Custom Security Policies**: Define and enforce protocol-specific security rules
