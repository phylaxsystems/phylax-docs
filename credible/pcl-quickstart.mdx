## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating, testing, and submitting an assertion using the `pcl` (Phylax Credible Layer) CLI. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to:

1. Set up your project structure
2. Test your assertion
3. Authenticate with `pcl`
4. Deploy your contract
5. Create a project
6. Store your assertion
7. Submit your assertion to the Credible Layer
8. Activate your assertion
9. Verify that the assertion is working

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- `pcl` CLI installed (see the [Installation Guide](credible/credible-install))
- Solidity compiler [installed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html)
- Foundry installed (see the [Foundry Installation Guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation))
- A browser wallet for authentication (MetaMask or similar)
- Access to the Credible Layer Demo, reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/phylax_credible_layer) if you're interested in getting access

## 1. Project Setup

We've created an example project with containing some complete assertion examples that work out of the box and that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.

The project can be found [here](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/credible-layer-starter).

For a detailed understanding of what an assertion is and how it works, see the [Assertion Guide](/credible/pcl-assertion-guide). For testing assertions, see the [Testing Assertions](/credible/testing-assertions) guide.

<Note>
    The `credible-layer-starter` repo has several examples that you can deploy and try out once you're done with this guide.
    Specific instructions can be found in the [README](https://github.com/phylaxsystems/credible-layer-starter/blob/main/README.md).
</Note>

You can clone the example project by running the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/phylaxsystems/credible-layer-starter.git
cd credible-layer-starter
```

Once cloned you have a repository with all required dependencies.

## 2. Running Tests

Use the `pcl` CLI to run your tests:

```bash
pcl test
```

This command will compile your assertion and run the tests.
You should see output looking like this indicating that the tests have passed:

```bash
Ran 2 tests for assertions/test/OwnableAssertion.t.sol:TestOwnableAssertion
[PASS] test_assertionOwnershipChanged() (gas: 806650)
[PASS] test_assertionOwnershipNotChanged() (gas: 804708)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 648.17ms (1.11s CPU time)
```

### Troubleshooting Test Issues

If your tests fail, check for these common issues:

- **Compilation errors**: Ensure your Solidity syntax is correct
- **Incorrect imports**: Verify all import paths are correct
- **State mismatch**: Make sure your test properly sets up the initial state
- **Assertion logic**: Double-check the logic in your assertion function

## 3. Deploy Your Contract

You can deploy the Ownable contract using the following command:

```bash
forge script script/DeployOwnable.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --sender <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

Explanation of the arguments:

- `<RPC_URL>`: The RPC URL of the network you're deploying to
- `<PRIVATE_KEY>`: The private key of the account you used to sign in to the dApp
- `<DEPLOYER_ADDRESS>`: The address of the account you used to sign in to the dApp

Make sure to note down the address of the deployed contract as you'll need it to create a project in the next step.
It will be the `Deployed to:` address in the output of the command.

## 4. Authenticating with Credible Layer

Here's a full video that you can consult to follow along with the process entire process from authentication to activating the assertion:

Before submitting your assertion, you need to authenticate:

```bash
pcl auth login
```

<Note>
    Make sure to use the same address as you set as the initial owner of the contract in the previous step.
</Note>

This will provide you with with a URL and an authentication code that you can use to authenticate with the Credible Layer.

If authentication fails, ensure:
- Your wallet has the correct network selected
- The `pcl` CLI uses the correct url
- You have an internet connection
- The `pcl` CLI is properly installed

## 5. Create a Project

Once you have deployed your contract, you'll need to create a project in the dApp if you don't have one already. Navigate to the browser window opened by the `pcl auth login` command and create a new project. When asked to link your contract, use the address of the contract you deployed in the previous step.

For a more detailed overview of how to use the dApp and manage projects, see the [dApp Guide](/credible/dapp-guide).

## 6. Storing Your Assertion

Next, store your assertion in the Assertion Data Availability layer (Assertion DA):

```bash
pcl store OwnableAssertion
```

Here `OwnableAssertion` is the name of the assertion.

This command submits your assertion's bytecode and source code to be stored by the Assertion DA, making it available for verification by the network.

## 7. Submitting Your Assertion

Finally, submit your assertion to the Credible Layer dApp:

```bash
pcl submit
```

This will prompt you to select the project and assertion(s) you want to submit. Follow the interactive prompts to complete the submission.

Alternatively, you can specify the project and assertion directly as per the output of the `pcl store` command:

```bash
pcl submit -a 'OwnableAssertion' -p <project_name>
```

Note, that `<project_name>` is the name of the project you created in the dApp, capitalized in the same way as you did when creating the project.

## 8. Activating Your Assertion

Last step is to go to the dApp and activate the assertion. Go back to the url that you opened with the `pcl auth login` command and navigate to the project that the assertions was added to. 

You'll notice that there's one assertion ready for submission, go ahead and proceed to review and activate it.

For a more detailed overview of how to use the dApp, see the [dApp Guide](/credible/dapp-guide).

## 9. Verify That The Assertion Is Working

Now that your assertion is activated, let's verify that it's working as expected. We'll do this by attempting to change the ownership of the contract, which should trigger our assertion and prevent the change.

First, let's check the current owner of the Ownable contract. Replace `ADDRESS_OF_OWNABLE_CONTRACT` with the address of your deployed Ownable contract and `RPC_URL` with your network's RPC URL:

```bash
cast call <ADDRESS_OF_OWNABLE_CONTRACT> "owner()" --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

This command should return the initial owner address that was set when we deployed the contract.

Next, let's attempt to transfer ownership to a new address. Make sure you replace `NEW_OWNER_ADDRESS` with an address that is not the initial owner and `PRIVATE_KEY_OF_THE_OWNER` with the private key of the owner of the contract. This transaction should trigger the assertion and revert:

```bash
cast send <ADDRESS_OF_OWNABLE_CONTRACT> "transferOwnership(address)" <NEW_OWNER_ADDRESS> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY_OF_THE_OWNER> --timeout 20
```

The transaction should timeout after about 20 seconds which means that the assertion reverted the transaction:

```bash
Error: transaction was not confirmed within the timeout
```

If you try to do another transaction with the same private key, you will most likely get this a replacement transaction error:

```bash
- server returned an error response: error code -32603: replacement transaction underpriced
```

This is a known limitation of the system - when an assertion reverts a transaction, it gets dropped by the builder rather than being included in a block. This means that wallets and tools like `cast` will still increment their local nonce, potentially causing issues with subsequent transactions. While this creates some UX friction, it only occurs when someone attempts to violate an assertion (i.e., attempt to hack a protocol), so we consider this an acceptable tradeoff. In the future, we plan to work with wallet providers to better surface these dropped transactions.

We recommend doing a simple ether transfer with a higher gas price, to replace the dropped transaction:

```bash
cast nonce <your-address> --rpc-url <your-rpc>
```

and then use the nonce to send a new transaction:

```bash
cast send <your-address> --value 0 --gas-price <higher-gas-price> --nonce <nonce> --private-key <your-private-key> --rpc-url <your-rpc>
```

To confirm that the ownership hasn't changed, let's check the owner again:

```bash
cast call <ADDRESS_OF_OWNABLE_CONTRACT> "owner()" --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

The owner should still be the original address, confirming that our assertion successfully prevented the ownership change.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created, tested, activated and verified your first assertion using the Credible Layer CLI. You can now go ahead and start implementing assertions in your own projects.
