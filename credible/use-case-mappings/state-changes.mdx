title: Variable State Change Tracking
description: Track and assert all values assigned to a specific storage variable during a transaction's execution, including intermediate states.

## Status

- [x] Supported
- [ ] Partially Supported
- [ ] Not Supported Yet

## Implementation Details

### Required Cheatcodes

- `getStateChanges(address aa, bytes32 slot)`

### Example Implementation

Protocol:

```solidity
// Example contract code if needed
contract MonotonicallyIncreasingValue {
    uint256 public value;

    function setValue(uint256 value_) external {
        value = value_;
    }
}
```

Assertion:

```solidity
contract StateChangesAssertion is Assertion {
    MonotonicallyIncreasingValue public protocol;

    constructor(MonotonicallyIncreasingValue protocol_) {
        protocol = protocol_;
    }

    function triggers() public view override {
        registerCallTrigger(this.assertionStateChanges.selector);
    }

    function assertionStateChanges() public view {
        uint256[] memory changes = getStateChangesUint(address(protocol), 0x0);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < changes.length - 1; i++) {
            require(changes[i] < changes[i + 1], "Value is not monotonically increasing");
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementation Notes

- **Storage access helpers:**
    - The `getStateChangesTYPE()` helper functions return the changes for the given slot cast to the respective type
    - Storage layout packing has to be handled by the user

- **State change ordering:**
    - The `getStateChanges()` function returns the changes in order of changes being made
    - To access values of a mapping, the slot has to be calculated manually
    - The pre-execution value is not included in the state changes

## Example Use Cases

- Make sure that a variable never changes its value:
    - Implementation slot of a proxy
    - Owner of a contract

- Make sure assigned values meet certain criteria:
    - Price oracle increases/decreases max by x%
    - Address changed to a whitelisted value

## Known Limitations

1. **Slot granularity**
    - User can only request on a slot level, not on a variable level
    - User has to know the storage layout of the contract
    - User has to potentially shift/mask for the correct bits of the slot

2. **Slot Coupling**
    - Arrays of state changes of different slots don't give you timing guarantees
        - i.e. There is no guarantee that `changes1[1]` and `changes2[1]` held the value at the same time
        - Unless the user knows exactly when state changes occur, it is not recommended to assume timing guarantees

## Future Improvements

- Provide variable level access
- Allow masking/shifting for correct bits of the slot in helper functions
- Allow coupling of variables
    - stateChanges provide snapshots of the requested slots
