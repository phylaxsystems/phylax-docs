title: Introduction
description: This section documents the various use cases that can be implemented with the Credible Layer's cheatcodes. Each mapping demonstrates how specific cheatcodes enable different types of on-chain assertions.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Use Case Mappings**: Documentation of different assertion capabilities enabled by Credible Layer cheatcodes
- **Implementation Examples**: Code samples showing how to implement each use case with the appropriate cheatcodes
- **Status Indicators**: Clear labeling of which use cases are fully supported, partially supported, or not yet supported

Each mapping includes example code with both the protocol contract being monitored and the corresponding assertion implementation. The examples demonstrate the technical approach for implementing different types of validations using the available cheatcodes.

The mappings are organized to help you understand what's currently possible with the Credible Layer. For each use case, you'll find implementation details, example code, and notes about any limitations or considerations.

We also document unsupported use cases to provide transparency about current system limitations and potential future capabilities.
