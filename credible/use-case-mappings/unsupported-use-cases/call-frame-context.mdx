title: Call Frame Context
description: Gain fine-grained context about a call frame in order to improve the precision of assertions by allowing to access pre and post call frame states.
---

## Status

- [ ] Supported
- [ ] Partially Supported
- [x] Not Supported Yet

## Implementation Details

### Required Cheatcodes

- A cheatcode which attaches an assertion to a specific call frame
- Potential access functions to retrieve pre/post states within the specific call context

### Example Implementation

### Implementation Notes

- **Call frame isolation:**
    - The implementation is similar to the [function-call-inputs](/credible/use-case-mappings/function-call-inputs) use case
    - The main difference is that the context, the assertion is running on, is only the specific
      call frame and its pre and post state

- **Benefits over transaction-level assertions:**
    - Provides more precise state validation at the individual function call level
    - Allows validation of intermediate states within a transaction
    - Makes complex, multi-function transactions easier to validate

## Example Use Cases

- See [function-call-inputs](/credible/use-case-mappings/function-call-inputs) and break it down to single call frames.

## Known Limitations

- Recursive function calls are not supported and might be difficult to be tracked
  - Recursive calls will compound the state changes similar to traditional executions on the transaction level
  - Users have to ensure that no recursive function calls are possible

## Future Improvements

- Provide handling for recursive execution calls
