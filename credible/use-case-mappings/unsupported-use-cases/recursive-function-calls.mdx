title: Recursive Function Calls
description: Track the expected behavior of function calls, even if they are recursive.
---

This is similar to the [call-frame-context](/credible/use-case-mappings/unsupported-use-cases/call-frame-context) use case, but it solves the limitation that recursive
function calls are not supported.

## Status

- [ ] Supported
- [ ] Partially Supported
- [x] Not Supported Yet

## Implementation Details

### Required Cheatcodes

### Example Implementation

### Implementation Notes

TBD

## Example Use Cases

- Some protocols allow for callbacks which could result in recursive function calls
- This would prevent false positives

## Known Limitations
